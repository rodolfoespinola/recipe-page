# Recipe Page

This is my second project from the freeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) curriculum.

## Overview
A simple webpage for a Speculoos Cookies recipe, built to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Features
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with `<header>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS**: External stylesheet (`style.css`) with `background-color`, `margin`, and `text-align` for a clean design.
- **Accessibility**: Descriptive `alt` text for images and proper link attributes (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener"`).

## What I Learned
- Organizing content with semantic HTML tags.
- Styling a webpage with an external CSS file (`style.css`).
- Centralizing elements using `margin: 0 auto` and `display: block`.

## Next Steps
- Continue the Full Stack Developer curriculum.
- Deepen CSS knowledge with layouts and responsiveness.

## Setup
To view locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rodolfoespinola/recipe-page.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a Live Server.
